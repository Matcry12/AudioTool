Chapter 2: “Don’t Get Cocky,” Said God
The men’s eyes mixed scorn with mockery, and Subaru, receiving those looks, now weighed them in turn.
Mid-twenties, maybe. Their dirty clothes matched faces that wore their mean spirits openly. Not demi-humans, but not decent either.
“Crap. Forced event.”
He wiped his face and scrambled to his feet, facing their thin smiles.
These were robbers—obviously. And in this setting, they might take not only his things but his life.
Mission 1: “Repel the Robbers.” Victory condition: eliminate all enemies. Defeat condition: Subaru dies. Something like that.
A chill ran up his spine; he slapped his cheeks and ignored it.
Boldness was his best bet. Hesitate and he’d die. Decision-making—he trusted that, at least.
“Also, this is an isekai. If I’m in the OP-protagonist pattern, maybe I’m stupid strong here. Like, gravity’s a tenth of normal… thinking that, I’m already feeling lighter! This might actually work!”
“He’s muttering to himself.”
“He doesn’t get the situation. Let’s teach him.”
While Subaru’s mood rose, their response stayed cold.
He puffed his chest out anyway and said,
“Enjoy the moment while you can. Guys like me daydream this exact back-alley thug scenario all the time. I mow you down and turn it into XP for a better tomorrow.”
“I don’t get what you’re blabbing about, but you’re mocking us. I’ll kill you.”
“That’s… my line!”
He moved before they did—Subaru’s preemptive strike.
He slipped in close and fired a right straight with everything he had. His fist smashed the lead thug’s nose; his knuckles split on the man’s teeth.
—That was my first punch! Also, this hurts more than I thought!
He’d practiced the scenario in his head, but this was his first real go.
The man crumpled and didn’t move. Riding the surge, Subaru sprang at another thug.
“Take this! The high kick enabled by my post-bath stretching!”
“Guh!”
His foot arced and cracked the man on the temple, bouncing him off the wall and leaving him writhing.
With the fight going better than expected, Subaru’s “I’m OP” belief hardened into conviction.
“So it is my strong-in-this-world setting! Adrenaline’s pumping—this is in the bag—”
He wheeled to finish the last man, crouching to spring.
Then he saw the glint in that last man’s hand.
A knife.
His crouch folded into a collapse.
“Sorry, this is completely my fault, I apologize, please spare my life—!”
He prostrated himself. The highest—and lowest—expression of surrender in the way of Wa.
His bravado evaporated. Blood drained from his face with an audible rush as he ground his forehead into the dirt, clinging to mercy.
Because knives were impossible. One stab and it’s over. He had zero skills for knife-fighting.
He realized, too, that the two he’d floored were already up again. One clutched a bleeding nose; the other shook off his dizziness. Otherwise, both looked fine.
“Huh!? Why did my OP attacks do so little!? Where’s the genre guarantee!?”
“Quit spewing nonsense! You’re gonna pay for that!”
A boot slammed his face into the ground, scraping his brow raw and drawing blood.
Kicks followed. Curled into a ball, he took them, one after another.
—Crap. This hurts. I might actually die.
They had no mercy for the one who struck first, and unlike back home, nothing said street punks wouldn’t kill you. They might very well beat him to death.
He could try a last-ditch rampage. If he’d done it before taking damage, maybe. Now, one good hit back would be a miracle. But dying like this? No.
“Don’t you move, idiot!”
“Ow ow ow! It hurts! It really hurts!!”
He tried to rise; a heel crushed his palm, wringing a scream out of him.
The knife-man, spitting as he snarled, flushed red with rage and flipped the blade into an ice-pick grip.
“I’ll make sure you can’t move, then strip you bare. Think you’re funny, do you?”
“If… if it’s valuables you’re after, you’re wasting your time. I’m broke…!”
“Then your weird clothes or those shoes’ll do. You can be big rats’ dinner in this alley.”
Oh. So this world has rats. Sounds like starter monsters.
He watched the knife lift and, absurdly, that thought drifted through his head.
No life-flashing montage. No bullet-time slowdown.
It would all just snap off—right then.
“Outta the way, outta the way! You guys are seriously in my way!”
A breathless voice rang out as someone dashed into the alley.
The men jerked, faces twisting. Subaru, barely able to move, lifted his eyes to follow.
A girl swept through his vision.
A small girl with semi-long blond hair streaming behind her.
Strong-willed eyes, a mischievous hint of protruding canine. A cheeky face, but cute for her age.
In dirty, over-worn clothes, she’d burst into the scene of an attempted robbery-murder.
The timing was too perfect. The last spark of hope struck a pose inside Subaru.
This was it—this was the flow he’d been waiting for. A righteous girl, brimming with chivalry, would save the feeble flame of his life, on the verge of going out—
“Wow, that looks rough, sorry! I’m really busy! Live strong, okay!”
“Wait—what!? Seriously!?”
But his hope shattered in an instant.
She met his eyes, raised a hand in apology, and sprinted on. She shot past the men and deeper into the alley that should have dead-ended.
She kicked a board propped in the cul-de-sac, found holds in the wall, and scrambled up in a blink, vanishing onto the rooftops.
Silence fell like a dropped curtain.
She’d blown through like a typhoon. Everyone stood there stunned. Subaru’s situation, however, was unchanged.
“Did that chill you out and maybe change your mind!?”
“If anything, that killed the mood. Don’t think you’ll go easy.”
The knife-man’s eyes gleamed for real. This time Subaru truly thought it was over.
His hand was still pinned under the man’s heel. Even if he tried to rise, he’d be a beat too late.
Resignation swallowed his chest.
Was this it? Ending here, after doing nothing?
He hadn’t lived a particularly admirable life, sure, but this was too cruel an end. If he asked what he’d done to deserve it, the answer would be, “Nothing.” A hollow end to a hollow run.
It wasn’t the pain.
It was something else that made his eyes sting.
It wasn’t fear of ending. It wasn’t even hating death.
He simply couldn’t stand the thought of ending empty.
“—That’s far enough, villains.”
The voice cut through everything—the roar of the crowd, the men’s coarse jeers, Subaru’s ragged breathing—and rang through the alley.
